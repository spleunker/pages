<h1>Is Wayland Ready?</h1>

<p>In short, mostly. The bare essentials are fully functional but what essentials? Things like: status bars, app-launchers, terminals etc. Everything you&rsquo;d need for a window-manager, but there are still some minor annoyances here and there.</p>
<p>One being the cursor&rsquo;s size or &ldquo;style&rdquo; switching between programs. It may take a few more months until all these minor problems have been ridden off but Wayland certainly does have the potentiality to replace Xorg. Look at GNOME! A complete desktop environment, if compatiable, completely running on Wayland, if that isn&rsquo;t the case it&rsquo;s probably running on Xwayland instead. But with nvidia open-sourcing their drivers this may change.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be this just play around a bit and dip your feet into the water. The first Wayland compositor I&rsquo;d recommend would be sway, one of the more popular and easily configurable Wayland compositors. It&rsquo;s much more similiar to i3 over from Xorg. But if&rsquo;d you like something similiar to dwm; dwl might do it for you!</p>
